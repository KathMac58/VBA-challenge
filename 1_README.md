# VBA-challenge
Module 2 Challenge

# Background of Challenge
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

# Instructions for Challenge
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

• The ticker symbol

• Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

• The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

• The total stock volume of the stock. 

• Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

• Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

• Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
